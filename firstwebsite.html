        <p>Two weeks ago,it was a sad week for both the red side and blue side of Manchester as both teams lost in the European stage with both being favourites in their matches. For now we are going to focus on the Red devils.</p>

        <h2>Manchester United</h2>
        <p>Manchester United headed to the Europa League Final in Gdansk to face the Europa League specialist,Unai Emery with his Villareal team.The Red devils had beaten Real Sociedad,AC Milan,Granada and AS Roma to reach the finals.However,Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was masterclassed by Unai Emery for him to claim the victory and to also get hands on the trophy for the fourth time.My next question is who is to be blamed for this loss?</p>

       <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fielded a very strong team with the likes of Fenarndes,Rashford,Greenwood and Cavani starting.He also dropped on of the pair of Mctominay and Fred in the double pivot by playing Mctominay and Pogba hence dropping Fred who had injury doubts.Manutd clearly missed Maguire for Gerard Moreno's goal in the 29th minute showed the defensive problems Manutd have especially when defending set pieces which has been a major weakness throughout the season.</p>

    <br>
        <p>Some question were raised when Ole decided to play Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof leaving out Axel Tuanzebe who in the few matches he played showed that he was better than Lindelof.It wouldn't be wrong to blame Lindelof for the first goal for not following his man.</p>

    <br>
        <p>Another thing to be noted was that Ole did not make any change for 90 minutes which had a great effect for after Cavani scoring the equalizer,Ole's Reds could not find a winner to kill the tie.This might have been due to fatigue.This makes one wonder why he did not make changes in the first place having the likes of Donny Van de Beek, Amad Diallo,Dan James and Juan Mata on the bench.His changes only took place in the 100th,113th,116th and 123rd minute.It seemed that Ole at extra time was content to take the game to penalties.If this was his plan,it failed terribly for David Degea's penalty miss costed his team. </p>

        <p>Manutd failed to break down Villareal's low block.This has been Manutd's problem all season whereby the struggle to break teams with a low block.This makes one to wonder is it the manager's fault or does the team need more creativity other than only depending on Bruno and Pogba for the creativity.</p>

    <br>
        <p>Maybe signing England Winger,Jadon Sancho and a specialist Central Defensive Midfielder can help Manutd's problems with the former adding creativity and competition to the squad and the latter would allow one of the pivots to be more attacking(Pogba or Donny)rather than playing two defensive minded midfielders in the pivot(Scott and Fred)which does limit attacking options for the team.</p>

    <br>
        <p>Signing another Centre Back to be a partner to the England skipper,Harry Maguire,would help the team to be defensively sound and would also eliminate the midfield pair of Scott and Fred(whose works is to more or less babysit the centre back pair of Maguire and Lindelof)Manutd will need to buy a quick Centre Back who would compliment Harry Maguire for Lindelof in the past two seasons has proved not to be good enough for he lacks pace and is often bullied by attackers.</p>

    <br>
        <p>Blaming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be a bit unfair.Yes he did show he was tactically naive in the final by not making any changes in a full 90 minutes,however,one should consider ManUtd did have a bad  summer transfer window by missing out on Jadon Sancho and only signing Alex Telles and Edinson Cavani on deadline day.Manutd also did have a bad start to the season by only winning three of their six first home games and losing 6-1 at home to Jose Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur.Manutd also did not have a proper pre-season due to their involvement in the Europa League which saw their season finish late.Despite all this he was able to turn around his season by finishing second in the Premier League and finishing the season unbeaten away from home. </p>
